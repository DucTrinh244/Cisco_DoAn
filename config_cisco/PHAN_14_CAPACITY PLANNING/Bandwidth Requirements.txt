### Bandwidth Requirements
```
=== TOTAL BANDWIDTH CALCULATION ===

1. GUEST WIFI (VLAN 10)
   - Users: 200 concurrent
   - Per user: 5 Mbps avg
   - Total: 1 Gbps
   - Burstable: 2 Gbps

2. CAMERA (VLAN 70)
   - Cameras: 14 @ 4 Mbps each
   - Total: 56 Mbps
   - Recording: 24/7
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Storage: 14 cameras × 4 Mbps × 3600s × 24h × 30 days / 8 = ~5.4 TB

3. ROOM DEVICES (VLAN 20)
   - Smart TV streaming: 80 rooms × 10 Mbps = 800 Mbps peak
   - IoT devices: minimal

4. STAFF (VLANs 30,40,50,60)
   - Users: 50
   - Per user: 2 Mbps avg
   - Total: 100 Mbps

5. TOTAL INTERNET BANDWIDTH NEEDED
   - Minimum: 2 Gbps
   - Recommended: 
     * VIETTEL: 2 Gbps (primary)
     * VNPT: 1 Gbps (backup)

=== SWITCH PORT REQUIREMENTS ===
- Core Layer: 10G uplinks, 1G downlinks
- Distribution: 10G uplinks, 1G downlinks  
- Access: 1G uplinks, 100M/1G access ports

=== POWER REQUIREMENTS (PoE) ===
Access Switches need PoE+ (802.3at):
- AP: 15W each × 25 APs = 375W
- Cameras: 8W each × 14 = 112W
- IP Phones: 7W each × 20 = 140W
- Total PoE: ~627W
- Overhead 30%: 815W total
- Switches: 2960-24PC (370W) × 8 = 2960W available ✓
